## The idea
The idea for this game just came out of the want to play something slower, constant, and awesome.
It will fit any genre as the theme and images will have the ability to be swapped out.
There will also be a lot of great quests as we will be building a quest engine for the public to write. There are amazing people out there, and we wanna hear your wonderful stories!

## Currently
We are currently in the early days of the concept and could use more hands on deck. There is a lot to be done to make this work and we hope you can join us. If you wish to there is a github project with tasks and if there isn't please contact any of the main contributors. You are more than welcome to fork the repo and go off on your own ideas, but we'd like to keep all the engine work pushed back to master. We are stronger as a team than alone. ;)

## Future
There will continually be work done to this game engine. If you have ideas please drop lines in the form of issues. We are all ears for great ideas and we know you have a whole lot of them out there.
